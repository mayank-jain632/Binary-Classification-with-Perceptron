# Binary-Classification-with-Perceptron
 ## Overview
"Binary Classification with Perceptron" is a method in machine learning where a simple model called a perceptron is trained to classify data into one of two categories, and this model does so with randomly created datasets in-house for testing and training efficiency. The perceptron algorithm, inspired by the brain's neurons, learns from labeled examples to create a decision boundary that separates the input space into distinct categories. Despite its simplicity, the perceptron has diverse applications, making it a versatile tool in artificial intelligence. This application of the model creates  datasets in-house that can easily be adjusted for the needs of the user to train and evaluate the model quickly and easily, eliminating the need to create new datasets. 

## Usage
