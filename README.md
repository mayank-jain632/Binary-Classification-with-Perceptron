# Binary-Classification-with-Perceptron
 "Binary Classification with Perceptron" is a method in machine learning where a simple model called a perceptron is trained to classify data into one of two categories. It's like a digital decision-maker that learns from examples to make predictions, making it a fundamental tool in the field of artificial intelligence.
